sudoku-solver-app
=================
This is a simple text-based [Sudoku](http://www.sudoku.name/rules/en) solver, written in Python 2.7.6. This project was developed for the Insight Data Engineering Fellows Program application for the January 2015 session. You can check out the repo for the Python sudoku solver [here](https://github.com/hyperbit/sudoku).

This also presented a great opportunity to learn a new technology. After first implementing the Sudoku Solver in Python, I went on create a web app out of it using the [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) framework. I must say, it was a fun learning experience.
